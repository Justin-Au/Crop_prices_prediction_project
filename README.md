# Crop Prices Prediction

This project aims to predict the price of cabbage in Taiwan's agricultural products market. The monthly price data between 01/1997 - 04/2019 are collected. The data between 01/1997-12/2016 are regarded as training data and the rest are regarded as testing data. Holt-Winters and ARIMA model are built for time series analysis. Their results are compared and ARIMA performs better in this case.
